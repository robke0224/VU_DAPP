## Overview
This project involves the creation of a **Smart Contract** using Solidity to implement business logic securely and reliably on the Ethereum blockchain. A **Decentralized Application (DApp)** is also developed to facilitate interaction with the smart contract through a front-end interface.

## Goals
- Implement a smart contract that ensures secure and reliable transactions between parties.
- Develop a front-end application for users to interact with the smart contract.
- Test the smart contract on both local and public Ethereum test networks.

## Requirements
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for smart contract development.
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) for testing and deployment.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for local Ethereum testing.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to interface with Ethereum networks.
- An Ethereum test network (e.g., Goerli) for public testing.

## Features
1. **Smart Contract**:
   - Implements business logic for a secure purchase/delivery process involving buyer, seller, and courier.
   - Ensures trustless interactions using Ethereum blockchain.

2. **DApp Front-End**:
   - Minimalist design to interact with the smart contract.
   - Extended functionality (optional) with enhanced features and UI.

3. **Testing**:
   - Local testing using Ganache.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Solidity for Smart Contract
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code (with Solidity extension), Truffle Suite
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Testing Tools**: Ganache, MetaMask
- **Front-End Framework**: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robke0224/VU_DAPP/tree/v0.2
   
2. Install Dependencies
  Run the following command to install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Set up the development environment:
      - Install Truffle:
  
       npm install -g truffle
	 
	 - Install Ganache.
	 - Install the MetaMask browser extension.

5. Compile the smart contract:
 
       truffle compile
       
6. Deploy the smart contract:
       
       truffle migrate

7. Start the local server for the DApp front-end:

		cd client
		npm run start
